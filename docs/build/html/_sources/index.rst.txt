ACCORD: Collaborative Research Computing on Sensitive Data
=============================================================
ACCORD is a collaboration across the public universities of Virginia
to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive 
data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, 
ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the 
financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. 
This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions 
across the United States.

What is ACCORD?
===============

ACCORD is a collaboration across the public universities of Virginia to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions across the United States.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, import data, and finally create and use disposable computing resources to perform their computational research.


Who can use ACCORD?
-------------------

This platform is open for approved academic research on highly sensitive data. Researchers from
institutions of higher education across the Commonwealth of Virginia are invited to request access.

ACCORD can meet HIPAA, FERPA, and other less-restrictive data sensitivity requirements. More
restrictive levels, such as CUI, FISMA, PCI cannot be satisfied.


How do I use ACCORD?
-----------------------

ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means that the primary software you need is a good, modern 
browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Once you have created a project, you will use the 
ACCORD Console to create an environment in which to do your work.

Most ACCORD environments are IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) or interactive code-data
platforms in wide use.

ACCORD has no SSH, Remote Desktop, or VNC access.

The ACCORD Team
===============

The ACCORD project was designed and built by the `Research Computing Group <https://www.rc.virginia.edu>`_ at the `University of Virginia <https://www.virginia.edu/>`_, under the coordination of the ACCORD Grant Program Manager
`Tho Nguyen <https://vpit.virginia.edu/tho>`_ (faculty, Computer Science) and `Ron Hutchins <https://vpit.virginia.edu/>`_, Vice Provost for Information Technology.
