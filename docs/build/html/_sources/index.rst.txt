What is ACCORD?
===============

ACCORD is a collaboration between the public universities of Virginia to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions across the United States.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, import data, and finally create and use disposable computing resources to perform their computational research.

How do I use ACCORD?
--------------------

ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means that the primary software you need is a good, modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Once you have created a project, you will use the ACCORD Console to create an environment in which to do your work.


Projects
========

The fundamental organizing unit for your work in ACCORD is a project. Within this platform, a project consists of:

(A) *Researchers* - a group of approved collaborators.
(B) *Data* - source and results data that you bring to the project. Data import/export is managed by Globus transfers.
(C) *Storage* - storage within the infrastructure dedicated to your project.
(D) *Computing Environments* - your choice from an approved library of web-based computing environments.

Security
========

Authentication
--------------

ACCORD makes use of InCommon authentication, a federated SAML-based standard used by most institutions of higher education in the U.S. This means that ACCORD does not have its
own user identity store but instead relies upon authentication via your home institution's single sign-on tool.

Encryption
----------

All connectivity to ACCORD environments is encrypted using SSL certificates over HTTPS. 

Isolation
---------

ACCORD environments cannot, by design, have any access to other environments -- including storage, network connectivity, or data. Environments run within isolated Kubernetes pods
and their network connectivity is isolated and encrypted.


Private Environment URLs
------------------------

[TODO] When you request an ACCORD environment, a unique HTTPS endpoint is created for you something like this:

    https://jupyter-notebook-1a2b3c4d5e-mst3k.uvarc.io/

Using certificate authentication from your browser (something you will set up the first time you use ACCORD and will renew annually), the platform
verifies that you, and only you, access that environment. If you want to collaborate with a co-investigator, they can simply create an identical
environment within the same project!

Miscellania
========

The ACCORD project was designed and built by the `**Research Computing Group**`_ at the University of Virginia, under the coordination of the ACCORD Grant Project Manager
Tho Nguyen (faculty, Computer Science) and Ron Hutchins, Vice Provost for Information Technology.
