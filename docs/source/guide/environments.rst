Environments consist of web-based, containerized interfaces launched on-demand by researchers. Approved environemnts and details about them are below. 

Theia Python
-----------------
A rich IDE that allows researchers to manage their files and data, write code with an intelligent editor, and execute code within a terminal session.

Jupyter Notebok
----------------------
Allows for interactive, notebook-based analysis of data. A good choice for pulling quick results or refining your code.

RStudio
----------------
The standard IDE for research using the R programming language. This environment is useful for generating plots and other R-based analysis.

These computing environments can be used for short-lived, interactive, computing and analysis OR you can kick off a longer, more intensive job to run for hours. For longer
runs, you may close your browser tab and return later, if so desired.

While ACCORD is not a BYOC (Bring Your Own Container) environment, we welcome your suggestions for additional containers to be considered in the future.
