Getting Access
---------------

ACCORD is a collaboration across the public universities of Virginia to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions across the United States.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, import data, and finally create and use disposable computing resources to perform their computational research.
