The fundamental organizing unit for your work in ACCORD is a project. Within this platform, a project consists of:

(A) *Researchers* - a group of approved collaborators.
(B) *Data* - source and results data that you bring to the project. Data import/export is managed by Globus transfers.
(C) *Storage* - storage within the infrastructure dedicated to your project.

.. note::

Most research computing platforms strongly associate projects with a specific computing environment. For example,
a VM (virtual machine) is a dedicated computing resource with storage, data, and user access bundled together into a 
single unit.

In the case of ACCORD, the computing environment you used is completely independent of your personnel, data, and storage. This means
that you can create and use a variety of environments depending on your research needs on any given day.

(D) *Computing Environments* - your choice from an approved library of web-based computing environments.


Researchers
-----------
Principal Investigators must enroll in the ACCORD platform and be an approved user. PIs can then manage
adding or removing additional personnel, moving code and data, and overall storage.

Co-investigators must also enroll in the ACCORD platform and gain approval. 
Once co-investigators are onboarded into the platform, PIs can add them
to their project(s).

ACCORD makes no distinction between various project personnel when assigning permissions. 
All project members have equal access to project data, i.e. there is no priviledged user or access for any given project.

Data
------
Can be managed using the Globus federated GridFTP platform. The ACCORD DTN (data transfer node) endpoint
address can be found once you sign into the ACCORD Console.

Storage
----------
1TGB of storage will be allocated for each project by default. Additional storage can be purchased for a fee.

Computing Environemts
---------------------
Environments are containerized web interfaces created on-demand for you to use with your project data and code. Environments cannot span two projects at the same time.
