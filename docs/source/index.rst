What is ACCORD?
===============

ACCORD is a collaboration between the public universities of Virginia to build and share cyberinfrastructure for research on highly sensitive data. Made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ACCORD attempts to provide a service for institutions that may lack the financial, staffing, or technical resources to support such a platform. This project strives to be a repeatable model for other institutions across the United States.

ACCORD is project-based, which means that investigators request access to the platform, create a project and populate it with co-investigators, import data, and finally create and use disposable computing resources to perform their computational research.

How do I use ACCORD?
--------------------

ACCORD is entirely web-based, which means that the primary software you need is a good, modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Once you have created a project, you will use the ACCORD Console to create an environment in which to do your work.


Projects
========

The fundamental organizing unit for your work in ACCORD is a project. Within this platform, a project consists of:

(A) *Researchers* - a group of approved collaborators.
(B) *Data* - source and results data that you bring to the project. Data import/export is managed by Globus transfers.
(C) *Storage* - storage within the infrastructure dedicated to your project.
(D) *Computing Environments* - your choice from an approved library of web-based computing environments.
